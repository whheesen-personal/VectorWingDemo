# System Requirements for Military Flight School

# Scheduling & Training Platform

## Introduction

This document details the **system requirements** for a browser-based aviation scheduling and training
platform tailored to military flight schools. The platform is organized into distinct modules, each
addressing a key aspect of scheduling and training management. It is designed as a **web-based system**
accessible via modern browsers on both PC and mobile devices (responsive design). Emphasis is
placed on robust security (including biometric integration), modular architecture, and scalability to
support large user bases and data volumes. The table below summarizes the core modules and their
primary functions:

Each module is broken down by **User Requirements** (functional and UI expectations), **Non-Functional
Requirements** (performance, reliability, usability, etc.), and **Domain-Specific Requirements** (unique to
military aviation training). The following sections provide an exhaustive list of requirements per module,
along with development considerations for security, modularity, and scalability.

## Scheduling Module

**Overview:** The Scheduling module handles the creation and management of flight schedules (and
related training event schedules) for the flight school. It provides an intuitive calendar interface for

```

```

planners to assign missions, training flights, and simulators, while automatically enforcing operational
rules and resource constraints. Users (schedulers, instructors, students) can view schedules in real-time
and receive updates when changes occur.

### User Requirements (Scheduling)

```
Intuitive Schedule Interface: Provide a user-friendly scheduling interface (e.g. drag-and-drop
calendar) to build daily, monthly, and annual schedules. Users should be able to view
schedules in multiple formats (e.g. master calendar, by location/unit, or timeline grid) with
changes in one view reflected across all views.
Create & Modify Flights: Allow schedulers to create new flight entries (missions or training
sorties) and edit details such as date, time, route/leg, duration, and frequency of recurring
events. It should be easy to adjust flight details or reroute as needed to accommodate
changes.
Real-Time Updates: Ensure that all users (students, instructors, crew) can access the latest
schedules in real-time from any device. When a schedule is updated (e.g. due to weather or
maintenance issues), the changes should be instantly visible to all relevant personnel.
Conflict Detection & Alerts: Automatically detect scheduling conflicts or rule violations. For
example, if two flights are scheduled for the same aircraft or a pilot is double-booked, the
system should flag the conflict. Users should receive immediate alerts or warnings about
conflicts and discrepancies , allowing them to resolve issues before finalizing the
schedule.
Rule-Based Scheduling: Incorporate an engine that applies scheduling rules (crew rest
requirements, maximum flight hours, training prerequisites, etc.) while building the schedule.
The interface should visually highlight or prevent entries that violate these rules (e.g. if a pilot is
scheduled beyond duty-hour limits or lacks a qualification for a mission). Schedulers can
define or adjust these rules via the UI as needed (within admin permissions).
Schedule Adjustment & Flexibility: Enable schedulers to swiftly adjust the schedule for
unforeseen changes. Users should be able to cancel or delay missions, swap aircraft or
instructors, and reassign crew on short notice (e.g. due to flight delays, weather, or mechanical
issues). The UI should make it easy to drag or edit entries and to notify affected users of
changes (tie-in with Notifications module).
Visibility & Filtered Views: Provide filter options and different views for users to focus on
relevant information. For example, an instructor might view only their own sorties, a student
sees their training lineup, and a scheduler sees a global view of all assignments. Support a
shift calendar or timeline view to show who is on duty, open slots, and crew availability. This
improves situational awareness for planning.
```
### Non-Functional Requirements (Scheduling)

```
Performance & Scalability: The scheduling module must handle a high volume of entries
(potentially hundreds of flights and events per day) without performance degradation. Loading
the schedule or applying filters should be fast (e.g. under 2 seconds for daily view). The system
should scale to support multiple squadrons or training groups simultaneously – requiring
efficient queries and possibly caching of schedule data. If deployed enterprise-wide, the
architecture (e.g. microservices or cloud-based scaling) must allow additional servers/instances
to handle increased load (horizontal scalability).
Reliability & Concurrency: Ensure that updates to the schedule are handled reliably, especially
if multiple schedulers or administrators edit concurrently. Implement record-locking or
optimistic concurrency to prevent conflicts (e.g. two users editing the same flight). Changes
should never result in a corrupt or partially saved schedule – use transactions to commit or roll

back changes atomically. The schedule data should be persistent and backed up regularly, as it’s
mission-critical.
Usability: Use modern web design (HTML5/CSS3, responsive frameworks) for a responsive
interface that works on large desktop screens as well as tablets in the field. The drag-and-
drop and interactive elements should degrade gracefully on touch devices (allow touch
interactions for drag, or alternative input). Provide tool-tips, legends (for symbols or color codes
for different mission types), and quick navigation (e.g. jump to date, search for flights by callsign)
to enhance user experience. The interface should be consistent and intuitive so that schedulers
and instructors can learn it quickly (minimal training).
Real-Time Sync: The module should support real-time data sync (via web sockets or frequent
polling) so that if one user updates the schedule, others see updates immediately without
needing a page refresh. This ensures everyone operates on the current plan, critical for fast-
changing training environments.
Integration & Modularity: The Scheduling module must integrate with other modules (Crew,
Resources, etc.) through well-defined APIs or services. For example, when building a schedule, it
should pull data on crew qualifications and resource availability from the respective modules.
The design should be modular so that the scheduling engine can be updated or replaced (e.g. to
improve the auto-scheduling algorithm) without breaking other components. Loose coupling
and adherence to a service-oriented architecture (or microservices) are expected to achieve this
modularity.
Security (Scheduling Data): Enforce access controls so that only authorized users can modify
schedules (e.g. only scheduling officers or administrators can create/edit flights, instructors can
only view or make limited changes for their sessions, students have read-only access to their
schedule). All schedule data transmissions should be encrypted (TLS) and sensitive details (like
mission objectives or classified locations) must be protected from unauthorized access. Audit
logging should record any changes made to the schedule (who changed what and when) for
accountability.
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (Scheduling)

```
Compliance with Flight Rules: The scheduling system must comply with military flight
operations rules and training syllabi constraints. For example, it should enforce crew rest and
flight duty period limits as outlined in regulations (e.g. USAF’s AFI 11-202 Vol 3 crew rest rules, or
Navy NATOPS equivalents). If a scheduling action violates these rules, the system should
prevent it or require a waiver from an authorized role. Custom military-specific rules (such as
limiting student sorties per day, weather minimums for trainees, etc.) should be configurable
and enforced automatically.
Seniority and Qualifications: Incorporate military-specific considerations like crew seniority and
qualification levels into scheduling. For instance, when assigning instructors or evaluators to
flights, the system might prefer certain pairings (e.g. an instructor pilot must have an IP
qualification and possibly a minimum rank for certain missions). The rules engine should
support these domain constraints (e.g. student solo flights must be supervised by an instructor
on the schedule, or certain missions require an instructor with examiner status).
Duty Hour Monitoring: Provide a duty hour monitor or similar mechanism to track each
aircrew’s cumulative duty hours and flight hours per day/week/month. This feature increases
transparency of crew workload and ensures compliance with both safety standards and
currency requirements. For example, it can show how many hours a pilot has remaining this
week before hitting a limit. If a proposed schedule would exceed a pilot’s allowed hours, the
system flags it.
Mission Briefing Integration: The schedule entry for each mission should allow attaching
mission briefs or profiles (e.g. sortie profile, training objectives). In a military context, each flight
```

```
often has a mission briefing document – the system could store or link to this, accessible to the
crew. Additionally, if a mission requires a risk assessment or pre-mission checklist, the
scheduling module should integrate with those forms (possibly via the Training Records or
Authorization modules).
Operational Readiness Links: The scheduling should connect with operational requirements –
for example, if a certain training sortie is critical for a student’s progression or a squadron’s
mission-ready status , the system might prioritize those in auto-scheduling (if auto-schedule
algorithms are used). Also, cancelled missions might need to be flagged for reschedule to meet
syllabus timelines. In essence, the scheduler should be aware of training throughput goals and
include tools to ensure students meet their required flights on time.
Multi-Unit Coordination: Military training often involves multiple units or squadrons (e.g.
shared aircraft or joint training ops). The system should allow scheduling across units in a
coordinated way. This might mean the schedule can be filtered or partitioned by unit, but still
handle shared resources (e.g. a shared simulator building). It should also accommodate
deployments or detachments (if a training flight goes to another base, schedules should reflect
local times and resources accordingly).
Biometric Sign-Off Placeholder: (Note: The actual biometric integration is covered under
Authorization module below, but from a scheduling perspective, there might be a domain
requirement that prior to execution , each sortie on the schedule must be authorized by a
commander via biometric sign-off. The scheduling UI could indicate which missions are
authorized vs pending authorization.)
```
## Crew Management Module

**Overview:** The Crew Management module handles information about all personnel (student pilots,
instructor pilots, maintenance crew if needed, etc.). It serves as a repository of **personnel data** ,
including contact information, rank, role, qualifications, certifications, experience hours, and availability.
It closely interacts with Scheduling (to ensure only qualified and available crew are scheduled) and
Training Records (to update qualifications).

### User Requirements (Crew Management)

```
Personnel Profiles: Provide a detailed profile for each crew member (student or instructor).
Users with access (instructors, admins) should be able to view and update personal details like
rank, service ID, contact info, and assigned unit. Crucially, profiles include each person’s
qualifications and certifications (e.g. aircraft type ratings, instructor qualifications, medical
clearance status, ejection seat training, etc.) and their currency (when each qualification was last
used or is due to expire).
Qualifications & Currency Tracking: Allow training officers or administrators to input and
update qualifications and automatically track currency/expiration. The system should clearly
show if a crew member is qualified for a certain activity – for example, marking whether an
instructor is current to fly at night or if a student has passed the prerequisites for solo flight. If a
qualification expires or a required checkride is overdue, the profile should flag this (and the
Notifications module should send alerts).
Availability & Scheduling Integration: Enable crew members (or schedulers) to set availability
statuses – e.g. marking when an instructor is on leave, or a student is unavailable due to other
duties. The Scheduling module should respect these availability flags (e.g. do not schedule a
person who is on leave or in training elsewhere). A crew calendar might show each person’s
assignments and free times. This could include a leave/request system where crew can request
time off or swapping of assignments (with appropriate approval workflow).

```
Role-Based Views: Adapt the UI based on user roles. For example, an Instructor can view the
roster of students they oversee, including each student’s current training progress and
upcoming events. A Student can view their own profile and perhaps limited info like their grades
or remaining syllabus requirements. A Scheduler or Training Officer can browse and search the
entire roster, filter by qualifications (e.g. find all available IPs who can fly a certain aircraft), and
assign crew to missions from within the scheduling interface.
Timesheets & Flight Hour Logs: The system should maintain each pilot’s accumulated flight
hours (potentially by category: day/night, instrument, by aircraft type, etc.) and duty hours.
Instructors or crew can view their log summary which gets updated as training flights are
completed (this could be automatically updated from the Training Records module once flights
are marked done). This helps in monitoring experience levels and is useful for qualifications (e.g.
hitting a flight hour milestone). The crew profile could include a timesheet or flight log
component.
Crew Documents: Allow storage or linking of important documents per crew member. For
instance, scans of certifications, medical exam forms, or orders assigning them to the training
program. Users (with permissions) can upload and manage these documents in the profile. This
ensures all necessary paperwork is centrally available (no lost physical records).
```
### Non-Functional Requirements (Crew Management)

```
Data Consistency & Integrity: The crew data is foundational – ensure strict data validation and
integrity. For example, rank must be selected from valid values, dates (like qualification dates)
must make sense, and certain fields should be mandatory (e.g. each crew must have an assigned
squadron). The system should maintain historical records (when a qualification was earned or a
role changed) to have an audit trail of a person’s training history.
Performance: Queries on crew data (such as filtering by qualification or searching names)
should be optimized for quick results, even if the database contains thousands of personnel
records. Indexing and efficient query design are required, especially since the Scheduling
module will frequently query this data to verify qualifications and availability.
Security & Privacy: Enforce role-based access control on personnel records. Personal
Identifiable Information (PII) like contact and medical data must only be visible to authorized
users (e.g. an instructor can see their students’ records, but students cannot see others’ details).
Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest. All access to crew records should be logged (for
security auditing). The system should also comply with any military privacy regulations regarding
personnel data.
Usability: The interface for crew management should allow quick updates and overviews. For
instance, admin users might want to perform bulk actions (like marking a whole class of
students as having completed a certain ground training event). A user-friendly filtering and bulk-
edit capability can be provided. Additionally, the profile UI should be well-organized with
sections/tabs (e.g. Personal Info, Qualifications, Training Progress, Documents) for clarity. This
module should also be mobile-friendly so that, for example, an instructor on the flight line could
quickly pull up a student’s qualifications on a tablet or phone if needed.
Integration: The Crew module must feed into other modules seamlessly. It should expose
services or APIs that allow the Scheduling module to check a person’s qualifications, or the
Training Records module to update a person’s record when they complete a training event.
Modularity is important: this module could be swapped or updated (e.g. to integrate with an
official military personnel system) with minimal changes to others, as long as it adheres to the
agreed data interface.
Scalability: As the platform may be used by multiple training squadrons or even across an entire
training wing, the crew database could grow and see concurrent access from many users. The
system should handle concurrent updates (e.g. two admins editing different people’s profiles
```

```
simultaneously) without issues. It should also be scalable to handle additional units – potentially
partitioning data by unit or providing multi-tenant support if the same instance serves different
academies.
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (Crew Management)

```
Rank and Military Structure: Include military-specific fields in profiles, such as rank, branch of
service, and duty position (e.g. “Squadron Training Officer” or “Student Pilot Class 22-15”). The
system should understand hierarchy and possibly use rank in certain logic (for example, only a
senior officer or designated role can be the authorizer in the Authorization module). Display of
names should often include rank (e.g. “Capt John Doe”) as is standard in military environments.
Qualification Standards: The system must accommodate the specific qualifications relevant to
military aviation training. This includes tracking things like Mission Qualification Training
(MQT) status, Combat Mission Ready status (if applicable for advanced training units), water
survival training currency, physiological training (altitude chamber), and more. These are
domain-specific requirements that a civilian system might not track. The system should allow
administrators to define and update these qualification types and their valid durations or
criteria.
Training Pipeline Integration: A military flight school often has a set curriculum pipeline (e.g.
phases of training). The Crew Management module should integrate with the Training Records
module to reflect where each student is in the pipeline (e.g. “Phase 2 – Instruments” or “Awaiting
Initial Flight Training”). This context is domain-specific and can be used to filter or group
students (for instance, to easily see all students in a given phase, or all who are behind
schedule).
Special Clearances and Medical Status: Military flight training might involve tracking if a
student has special clearances (e.g. security clearance level if needed for certain training
missions or ranges) or current medical status (a pilot on DNIF – Duties Not Including Flying –
should be marked as not available). The system should have fields to track if a pilot is medically
cleared to fly or any temporary disqualifications. Only authorized staff can edit these fields, and
scheduling logic should respect them (e.g. DNIF pilots cannot be scheduled).
Interfacing with Personnel Systems: In a military environment, there may be existing
personnel databases. A domain requirement might be to interface or import data from official
personnel systems to avoid duplicate data entry. For instance, pulling basic info and rank from
a central system via a secure feed. This ensures the platform stays in sync with official records.
Audit and Accountability: Military operations require strict accountability. The Crew
Management module should maintain an audit log of all changes to qualifications and
availability (who made the change and when). This is important in case of investigations (e.g. if
someone was scheduled without a proper qual, there needs to be a record of how the data was
entered or missed). Additionally, when a person’s status changes (e.g. a new qual earned), the
system might require an electronic signature from a supervisor or examiner confirming it –
reflecting the formal sign-off process in training.
```
## Authorization Module

**Overview:** The Authorization module governs the **mission approval process**. In military flight training,
certain personnel (e.g. a Squadron Supervisor or Operations Officer) must authorize each flight or
training mission before it is executed. This module provides a workflow for approving or rejecting
missions, with strong identity verification. A key feature is integration with a **biometric scanner** for
mission authorization – meaning an approver (such as the commanding officer) must authenticate with
a biometric credential (e.g. fingerprint or iris scan) to digitally sign off on a mission. This enhances
security and accountability by ensuring the approval is given by the correct individual and is logged.

#### • • • • • •


### User Requirements (Authorization)

```
Mission Approval Workflow: For each scheduled mission (from the Scheduling module), allow it
to be submitted for authorization. Users with the appropriate role (e.g. Operations Supervisor,
Instructor Pilot acting as supervisor for a student solo) should see a list of pending missions
requiring approval. They can review details of the mission (crew, aircraft, weather, risk
assessment, etc.) and either approve or deny the mission from the interface. The UI should make
it clear which missions are authorized and which are pending.
Biometric Authentication for Approvers: Integrate biometric scanning in the approval step.
When an authorized approver clicks “Authorize” for a mission, the system should prompt for
biometric verification (such as a fingerprint scan or a facial recognition via device camera,
depending on hardware). The system must interface with a biometric scanner device connected
to the user’s computer or a mobile device’s biometric capability. The scanned biometric data is
used to verify the approver’s identity before finalizing the approval. This provides a secure
“digital signature” equivalent. Biometric technologies are integral to modern defense
operations , offering secure and fast identity assurance for critical activities. By requiring a
biometric sign-off, the platform protects the mission authorization process with high confidence
in the approver’s identity.
Digital Signature and Logging: Once approved, the mission should be marked with an
electronic signature (including approver’s name, timestamp, and method of auth). This record
should be visible in the schedule (e.g. a status icon “Approved” vs “Pending Approval”) and in
mission details. Users should be able to click to view who authorized it and when. All approvals/
denials should be logged for later audit. If a mission is denied, the system should allow the
approver to input a reason which is fed back to the scheduler or crew.
Pre-Mission Checklist Integration: Often, authorizing a mission involves verifying certain
prerequisites (weather check, risk assessment, briefing completed). The module should allow
attachment or completion of a digital checklist or risk assessment form as part of the
approval workflow. For example, an approver might have to confirm that the flight risk
assessment was reviewed. If integrated with the Training Records module, these forms could be
electronic and automatically included. The UI should present any required forms or data to the
approver for review (e.g. a student’s risk assessment score, or a link to the weather briefing).
Notifications of Authorization Status: Users (especially the pilots/instructors on the mission)
should receive notification when their mission is authorized or if it’s been rejected (with reason).
This can be via the Notifications module – e.g. an email or app notification saying “Mission X for
15:00 is authorized by Maj Smith” or “Mission Y was not authorized: weather below minima”. In
the UI, missions could highlight in green for authorized, red for rejected, etc., for quick
reference.
Override / Emergency Mechanism: Provide a mechanism for higher authorities or special
scenarios to override the standard process if needed (for example, if the biometric device is
down or in an emergency scramble, a mission might need quick authorization by a code or
alternate method). This should be tracked and limited to certain roles, and later followed up (to
avoid misuse). The UI for this could be a special “Emergency Authorize” button that requires a
second confirmation or a one-time passcode from a commander.
```
### Non-Functional Requirements (Authorization)

```
Security: This module deals with critical security controls. It must enforce strong
authentication – not only using biometrics but also ensuring the underlying system is secure.
Biometric data should never be stored in raw form; if storing templates for verification, they
must be encrypted and protected. Communication between the client device (browser) and the
server during a biometric scan must be encrypted and safeguarded against interception. The
module should likely comply with government security standards for handling biometric data
```

```
```

```

```
and identity verification. Regular security audits and certification (perhaps meeting DoD or NIST
standards) will be required.
Reliability: The authorization process should have near-zero downtime tolerance around
mission launch times. Approvers often authorize missions shortly before takeoff; any downtime
could delay training. The system should be available and responsive, especially during peak
periods (e.g. early morning when many missions are authorized). If the biometric subsystem fails
(hardware issue), the system should degrade gracefully (perhaps allow a CAC/PIN login or
fallback method so training isn’t halted).
Performance: Biometric authentication should be quick – e.g. fingerprint scanning and
verification should occur within a couple of seconds. The overall authorization transaction
(loading a mission package for review and signing it) should be efficient, as any sluggishness can
cause frustration for busy officers. The module’s backend should handle many concurrent
approval processes (if multiple approvers are working on different missions) without slowing
down.
Audit and Accountability: Non-functionally, the system must maintain an immutable audit log
for all authorizations. This includes recording the biometric verification result, the approver’s ID,
timestamp, and mission ID. These logs should be tamper-proof (or tamper-evident) and retained
for a long period (per military records retention policies). This is crucial for later investigations or
just to have a clear chain-of-command record.
Compatibility: The biometric integration should be flexible to different devices. On desktop, it
may need to support common USB fingerprint scanners (the system should be tested with
approved models). On mobile, it should leverage the device’s built-in biometric (fingerprint
sensor or face ID) via WebAuthn or similar modern web authentication standards if possible. The
system should use standard APIs for biometrics to remain compatible with future hardware.
Modularity: The Authorization module should be somewhat self-contained. For instance, if
down the line the military wants to use a different method of authorization (say a new smart
card system), the module should allow swapping out the biometric verification component
without overhauling the entire platform. A clear interface or service for “verify identity of user X
by method Y” would make it more modular. Also, if integrating with enterprise identity systems
(like DoD Common Access Card), the design should accommodate that either as an alternative or
supplement to biometrics.
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (Authorization)

```
Chain-of-Command Rules: The system must implement the specific approval chain required by
the military training environment. For example, student solo flights might require authorization
by the Squadron Supervisor on duty, whereas routine dual-instructor training flights might be
auto-authorized or authorized by a flight commander. The rules about who can authorize what
should be configurable to match military protocols. Only users with designated roles (e.g.
Operations Officer, Supervisor of Flying) can authorize missions, and the module should enforce
those permissions strictly.
Integration with Flight Authorization Documents: In many military units, a Flight
Authorization (FA) or similar paper form is used, listing all flights and signatures of approval.
The system should be able to generate an equivalent digital Flight Authorization report that
lists all missions for the day and their authorization status, which can be archived or printed if
needed (for legal flying orders). This might be a special report in the Reporting module, but it’s
driven by the Authorization data. It should meet whatever format the unit requires (which could
be a domain-specific format, possibly even requiring an authorized signature on a hard copy in
some cases).
Risk Management Integration: Military flights often require a risk assessment (e.g. using a
standardized risk management worksheet). The Authorization module should incorporate the
```
#### • • • • • • • •


```
results of that risk assessment. For instance, if a mission is assessed as “high risk”, the system
could require a higher-level approver’s biometric sign-off (like the Commanding Officer). This
dynamic requirement – adjusting who must authorize based on risk level – should be supported.
It’s a domain-specific logic reflecting safety protocols.
Biometric Data Handling Compliance: The use of biometrics in a military context likely triggers
compliance requirements (for example, compliance with DoD Biometrics standards or identity
management policies). Domain-specific requirement: the system must align with the DoD’s
biometric data handling guidelines, ensure any biometric info is stored in accordance with
defense standards, and possibly integrate with existing defense biometric databases if
applicable (for identity verification). For instance, the biometric scanner might need to be FBI-
certified hardware and use approved algorithms for fingerprint matching.
Multiple Authorization Levels: There might be scenarios where multi-layer authorization is
needed (e.g. a high-risk mission requires two officers to approve). The system should support
multi-factor or multi-person authorization for such cases. This is specific to the domain where
certain training missions or events (like weapons training flights or night solo flights for
students) might need two sets of eyes. The module could require two distinct biometric sign-offs
for those, and only mark the mission as fully authorized when both are completed.
Logging for Training Credits: In a training context, the authorization can also serve as a trigger
that a mission was officially flown under orders. The domain may require that only authorized
missions count toward training requirements. Therefore, the Training Records module should
only credit a sortie to a student’s record if it was properly authorized in this module. This
interlock ensures no “unauthorized” training event slips through unrecorded.
```
## Training Records Module

**Overview:** The Training Records module is responsible for tracking all training-related data for each
student (and possibly instructors’ qualifications). It maintains the digital **gradebook** for the flight
training program – logging every flight, simulator, and academic training event, the performance of the
student, and the sign-offs by instructors. It also manages the training curriculum or syllabus definition,
ensuring that each student progresses through required modules and that any changes to the
curriculum are version-controlled. This module essentially replaces or augments the traditional paper
training folders with a robust electronic system.

### User Requirements (Training Records)

```
Electronic Grade Forms: Provide electronic forms for instructors to grade or evaluate each
training event (flight or simulator or academic). For example, after a flight, an instructor can
fill out an evaluation form on a tablet/PC, rating the student’s performance on various
maneuvers and tasks. These forms should be customizable per the curriculum (different forms
for different phases or aircraft) and include sections for both grades and comments. The
instructor should be able to sign the form digitally, and the student can also sign or
acknowledge if required (possibly using CAC or a stylus signature).
Curriculum Management: Allow admin-level users to define and manage the training
curriculum (syllabus). The system should support setting up a hierarchy of training modules,
lessons, and objectives (for example: Phase II has a series of flight lessons, each with specific
maneuvers to be taught/graded). If the curriculum is updated (e.g. objectives change or a new
block is added), the system should maintain version control – past records tied to old curriculum
are kept, and new changes apply to future training. Updates to curriculum should
automatically propagate to relevant forms or scheduling templates, avoiding duplicate data
entry.

```
Training Event Logging: For each student, the module logs each completed training event,
along with the outcome (grade, pass/fail, etc.). Users (students and instructors) should be able to
pull up a training record report for a student, showing what has been completed and what
remains in the syllabus. The interface for instructors should make it easy to enter results for
multiple students if needed (e.g. after a simulator session with several students).
Qualifications and Certifications: When a student completes certain milestones (like first solo,
instrument check, final checkride), the system should update their qualifications in the Crew
Management module automatically. The training module should have business logic to mark
when a student is “qualified” in a skill or ready for a certificate. It should also track academic
requirements and automatically note when a student has completed all prerequisites for an
advancement.
Performance Dashboard: Provide a dashboard or overview for instructors and training officers
to monitor student progress. This may include visual indicators (like a progress bar through the
syllabus, or flags for students who are falling behind schedule or struggling with certain
maneuvers). Instructors can quickly see the proficiency trends of a student – e.g. if a student
has failed the last two flights in formation, that should be visible so they can adjust training.
Similarly, students should have access to their own progress view, so they know where they
stand and what’s upcoming.
Archive and Retrieval: The system should allow retrieval of historical training records quickly. If
a student from a previous class needs their records or an instructor wants to review how a
certain lesson was graded last year, the module should provide search and filter tools (by name,
date, lesson type, etc.) to retrieve past records. All records should be read-only archived once a
student graduates, but remain accessible for reference (with proper permissions).
```
### Non-Functional Requirements (Training Records)

```
Data Integrity & Consistency: Training records are official documents in a sense; thus, once an
event’s record is finalized (signed by instructor, and possibly acknowledged by student), it should
be locked from casual editing. Any changes after finalization should require special permission
or an addendum process (to maintain integrity). The system should ensure no records are lost
and use strong consistency (transactions) when saving forms. If connectivity is an issue (say, an
instructor is offline when filling a form), the system should queue or save locally and sync when
possible to prevent data loss.
Offline Capability: As training flights might occur in areas without network (or instructors may
prefer to fill grading on the jet or in remote sims), the system should support offline data entry
for training forms. For instance, a Progressive Web App or mobile app mode can allow an
instructor to download the day’s schedule and relevant grading forms, then later upload the
results when back online. This ensures flexibility and no dependency on constant
connectivity during flights.
Performance: When dealing with large datasets (years of records, or many students), the
module should still perform well. Generating a student’s training report or calculating class
averages should happen in seconds. The database should be indexed by student, class, date,
etc., to allow swift queries. Also, the system might need to produce complex queries (like “show
all students who have not completed Lesson X”) – those should be optimized or possibly run in
the background if heavy.
Security & Access Control: Training records contain evaluations and possibly sensitive
observations about performance. Access must be restricted: e.g. a student can only see their
own records (and perhaps a summary of their peers’ progress but not the detailed grades), an
instructor can see records of students they train, and a senior training officer can see everything.
The module should authenticate and authorize each access. Additionally, because these records
could be used in decisions (like eliminiation from training), they must be tamper-proof. All
```

```
changes or entries should be attributable to a specific user account with timestamp. Consider
using digital signatures so that a record can be proven to be signed by a certain instructor.
Scalability & Storage: This module will accumulate a large amount of data over time (daily
evaluations for every student). The system must be scalable in terms of storage (potentially
using cloud storage or partitioning by class year). Archival strategies might be needed (e.g.
archive older classes’ detailed data to a different storage or to static files, while retaining
summary info in the main DB). The design should ensure that scaling out (more storage, or even
distributing the module’s database) can be done without affecting the rest of the system.
Integration: The Training Records module should integrate with external analysis or learning
management systems if required. Non-functionally, an API could be provided for exporting
data for analysis (some military training programs might want to analyze performance data
separately using data analysis tools). Internally, it must integrate tightly with Scheduling (to
know which training events occurred) and Crew/Qualifications (to update statuses). The module’s
design should keep these interactions efficient – e.g. posting a grade might automatically update
a qualification, which means a cross-module call that should happen quickly and robustly.
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (Training Records)

```
AQP and ISD Compliance: The platform should support the Advanced Qualification Program
(AQP) framework and Instructional Systems Development (ISD) methodology where
applicable. In military aviation training (especially in advanced or continuation training), AQP
principles might be used. This means the system should allow definition of Job Task Analyses
(JTA) , Qualification Standards , and other elements that tie training tasks to higher-level
competencies. For example, each training maneuver might be linked to a skill/knowledge/
ability code; the system can store these linkages. This is a domain-specific way of structuring
training data to ensure a data-driven approach to curriculum effectiveness.
Multiple Grading Scales and Criteria: Military training may use complex grading systems (e.g.
Qual/Nonqual, or numeric scores, or descriptive grades). The system must allow multiple
grading scales to be defined and used for different lessons. For instance, basic flights might
be graded pass/fail, whereas advanced flights have numeric scores. The system should also
handle predetermined comment dropdowns (common comments for certain maneuvers) to
standardize evaluations. This ensures consistency in how instructors grade and give
feedback.
Qualification Expiry Alerts: The system should automatically alert relevant stakeholders when a
qualification or certification is due to expire or has lapsed. For example, if instrument rating
currency for a pilot is about to expire, the training officers get notified to schedule a refresher.
These alerts tie into domain rules (e.g. instrument check must be done every 12 months). The
Training Records module is where the last completion dates are recorded, so it should generate
these domain-specific notifications (likely feeding the Notifications module).
Proficiency Data Analysis: A domain-specific requirement is to collect and analyze proficiency
data to improve training. The platform should enable data-driven decision making – for
example, track how many repetitions of a maneuver each student needed before mastering it,
and provide reports that might highlight if a syllabus change is needed. The system
could anonymize and aggregate data to give insights, like “85% of students struggle in Lesson 5
```
- Formation Join-up, requiring an average of 1.5 extra sorties” – valuable info for commanders.
This is facilitated by the records module keeping detailed scores and notes for every training
event.
**Certification of Training Forms:** At the end of training or at key milestones, the system should
be able to produce official **“Certificate of Training”** documents or forms. These might be
required by the military to formally certify a pilot’s completion of the program or a qualification.
The requirement is that the system can populate and output these forms (with digital signatures)

so that the training can be formally recognized. This might also include integration with external
systems that track pilot training across the military, meaning the module could send a data
package or update to a central training registry once a student graduates.
Adapting to Military Processes: The module must adapt to military-specific processes rather
than forcing the military to adapt to the software. This means it should be highly
configurable to mirror exactly how the flight school runs its training. If a particular school has
unique steps (like an additional check ride or a different sequence), the system should be able to
accommodate that through configuration rather than custom code. Domain experts (admin
users) should be able to tweak workflows (e.g. require an extra evaluator sign-off for certain
flights) and the system should handle it, reflecting the rigid structure of military training
programs but with flexibility to customize to each program’s SOPs.
```
## Notifications Module

**Overview:** The Notifications module sends out alerts and messages to users about important events in
the system. Given the dynamic nature of flight training, timely notifications are critical – for example,
when a schedule changes at the last minute, or when a student’s qualification is about to expire. This
module will likely provide both in-app notifications (banner, badges) and external notifications (emails,
SMS, or push notifications to mobile) to ensure users stay informed.

### User Requirements (Notifications)

```
Real-Time Alerts: The system shall generate real-time alerts for key events, such as schedule
changes, new assignments, or required actions. For instance, if a flight’s time is changed or an
instructor is re-assigned, all affected users (the crew, the schedulers) should receive an
immediate notification in the system and via email/app notification. These alerts should be
clearly visible (e.g. highlighted bell icon or pop-up) when the user logs in, and accessible via a
notifications panel.
Email and Mobile Notifications: Support configurable email and/or push notifications for users
who are off the platform. A user should be able to opt in to receive an email or phone
notification when, say, a schedule is published or updated for the next day, or when they
receive a new message from an instructor. This ensures critical info reaches personnel who may
not be constantly logged in. Mobile push notifications (if the platform has a mobile app wrapper
or PWA) can alert on devices instantly – useful for urgent changes like a “Flight tomorrow at 0800
has been cancelled”.
Notification Preferences: Provide users with control over their notification settings. A pilot
might want all schedule changes and training results notifications, but perhaps not every
general announcement. The system should allow users to choose which events they get notified
about and through what channels (in-app only, email, etc.). However, some notifications might
be forced for safety (e.g. an alert about a grounded aircraft affecting their flight).
Acknowledgment and Tracking: For certain critical notifications, require acknowledgment. For
example, if an important safety bulletin is issued or a schedule change within short notice, the
system could ask the user to confirm they’ve seen it (e.g. click “Acknowledge” in the app). The
module should track acknowledgments so that instructors or schedulers can see who has not yet
viewed a critical update.
Announcements and Broadcasts: Apart from automated alerts, the module should allow
authorized users (like administrators or commanders) to send manual announcements to
groups of users. For instance, a training wing commander could broadcast a message to all
students about a policy change. The system should deliver these similarly (in-app and email) and
possibly pin them on a dashboard if needed. Users might see a “Notifications/Announcements”
section where these messages persist until read.

### Non-Functional Requirements (Notifications)

```
Timeliness: The notifications system must have minimal latency. When a triggering event occurs
(schedule change, new record, etc.), the notification should be dispatched within seconds. This
might involve using a message queue or real-time push service. The design should ensure that
even under heavy load (many events) the notifications do not get backlogged significantly.
Reliability: It is crucial that notifications are delivered reliably. The system should handle retries
for email or push in case of failures. If the platform experiences downtime, it should queue
notifications and send them when back up. Lost or undelivered notifications could result in
missed flights or actions, which is unacceptable. Logging of notification deliveries is important
so admins can audit that “yes, the cancellation notice was sent to Lt. Smith at 5:00 AM” for
example.
Scalability: The module should scale to potentially thousands of notifications, especially in
larger training wings or if the platform is used across multiple bases. It should be built on a
scalable service (e.g. using a cloud notification service or an SMTP server that can handle bulk
emails). Sudden bursts (e.g. publishing a new day’s schedule might trigger hundreds of
notifications at once) need to be handled gracefully.
Integration: The Notifications module works across all other modules and therefore should be
modular and loosely coupled. Other components should be able to invoke it via an interface (for
example, a Scheduling change calls a Notification service API with details). The notifications
system should format the message appropriately per channel. It should also integrate with
external systems if needed (for example, perhaps with a base-wide alert system or text message
gateway if critical).
User Experience: Non-functionally, the notifications should be designed to avoid overload. If a
user gets too many trivial alerts, they might start ignoring them. Therefore, the system might
implement some intelligent bundling (e.g. combine several minor schedule tweaks into one
summary notification if they occur close in time). Additionally, the in-app notification UI should
be clean, showing unread vs read, categorizing by type (schedule vs training vs system message)
to help users prioritize.
Security and Privacy: Some notifications might contain sensitive information (like details of a
mission or personal performance feedback). The module should ensure that such content is only
sent over secure channels and only to authorized recipients. For example, an email about a flight
schedule should not include classified details. Also, if push notifications are used, consider that
they might appear on a phone lock screen – so maybe only generic info in the push (“Schedule
updated, please log in for details”) to avoid leaking sensitive info.
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (Notifications)

```
Operational Alerts: In a military training context, there may be domain-specific alert types. For
example, Weather or Ops alerts – if the base declares a weather recall or some operational
pause, the system should notify all crews immediately. This might interface with base systems (if
the base operations center inputs a red flag, the platform broadcasts it). Ensuring all trainees
and instructors get urgent operational notices is critical in the domain.
Training Alerts: Send notifications related to training requirements unique to the military. For
instance, an alert to a student and their instructor if the student is approaching a training
deadline (e.g. “Student X has 2 weeks left to complete instrument check or will be eliminated per
policy”). Or alerts for upcoming checkrides or evaluations that need special preparation. These
ensure the training cadence is maintained and are specific to the structured nature of military
syllabi.
Chain-of-Command Notifications: The platform should notify the chain of command for certain
events. For example, if a student fails a flight (gets an unsatisfactory grade), an automatic
notification could be sent to the Squadron Commander or Flight Commander as per protocol.
```
#### • • • • • • • • •


```
This reflects the military practice of supervisory notification for failures or incidents. The
requirements should outline which events trigger such escalated notifications (these can often
be configured by policy in the system).
Integration with Duty Rosters: If the unit has an on-call duty (like Supervisor of Flying
schedule, or Duty Officer), the notifications system might need to integrate with that. For
example, a notification of a severe issue (like an aircraft emergency in training) should also alert
the current supervisor on duty. This might not be a core part of the scheduling system, but as a
domain consideration it could interface with how the unit assigns duty personnel and ensure
notifications reach them.
Acknowledgement and Compliance Tracking: In a military environment, tracking compliance
to notifications can be important. For instance, if a new safety bulletin is released, the system
might not only notify everyone but also track who has read and acknowledged it (perhaps
requiring them to click a confirmation). The requirement is that the system can produce a report
of acknowledgment, fulfilling a domain need for accountability (e.g. “100% of instructors have
acknowledged the new emergency procedure update”).
```
## Reporting Module

**Overview:** The Reporting module provides the ability to generate reports, analytics, and data exports
from the platform. It collates data from scheduling, training records, resource usage, etc., to produce
meaningful insights and official reports. Reports can range from daily flight schedules to individual
training reports to high-level readiness metrics for commanders. The module should offer both pre-
defined standard reports and flexible custom report queries.

### User Requirements (Reporting)

```
Standard Reports: Offer a suite of standard, commonly-used reports available at a click.
Examples: Daily Flight Schedule (listing all missions, crew, times for the day – useful for an
operations briefing), Student Training Report (summarizing a student’s entire performance and
achievements), Instructor Currency Report (listing which instructors are coming due for certain
refresher training), and Resource Utilization (e.g. how many hours each aircraft flew in a
month). These should be formatted clearly, printable, or exportable as PDF for briefing binders
or archival.
Custom Report Builder: Provide a user-friendly interface for authorized users (like analysts or
training officers) to query the database and generate custom reports. This might be a form
where they can select fields (e.g. “List of all flights between X and Y dates that were canceled and
reason” or “All students who have not completed Lesson 10”). The interface should allow filtering
by various criteria (date ranges, specific instructors, aircraft type, etc.) and the output can be
viewed on screen or exported (CSV/Excel) for further analysis.
KPI Dashboard: For key performance indicators (KPIs) like graduation rates, average hours per
student, cancellation rates, etc., the module should provide a dashboard view with charts and
graphs. Users (especially leadership) can view at a glance metrics such as sortie completion rate,
student progress distribution, instructor workload, aircraft utilization percentage, etc. This might
be an interactive dashboard updated in real-time.
Scheduling Analytics: Include specific analytics for scheduling efficiency – e.g., reports on
schedule conflicts over time, or how often reassignments happen due to maintenance, etc. Also,
a forecasting report could be valuable: based on the current schedule and student pipeline,
predict if the unit is on track to meet training output (for example, “projected graduations vs
target”). Such reports help in resource planning and are tailored to the training environment.
Export & Data Sharing: Users should be able to easily export reports in various formats (PDF for
formal reports, Excel for data analysis, CSV or XML for interfacing with other systems).
```
#### • • • • • • •

```
33 34
```

```
There might also be a need for integrated data feeds to other command-level systems – for
instance, automatically sending a nightly training summary to a headquarters database. A user
with appropriate role should be able to set up scheduled exports or feeds (with security
considerations) without needing a developer.
```
### Non-Functional Requirements (Reporting)

```
Performance: Generating reports, especially complex ones that aggregate a lot of data, should
be optimized. The system may need to use pre-computed aggregates or a data warehouse
approach for heavy analysis so as not to slow down the transactional part. For example, a report
that analyzes years of training data should not lock up the live system – it could run on a
replicated database. Aim for most standard reports to generate within a few seconds. For very
large data sets, provide progress indicators or asynchronous generation with a notification when
ready.
Accuracy and Consistency: Reports must reflect accurate and up-to-date data. If the system is
distributed, ensure that data synchronization issues do not cause reports to be generated on
stale data. The calculations (like summing flight hours or counting qualifications) should be
carefully implemented to avoid errors. It’s important because decisions (and possibly official
records) will be based on these reports. Consider versioning of reports if the underlying data
changes while a report is being viewed (though likely reports are snapshot in time).
Security: Access to certain reports should be restricted. For example, a student should not be
able to run a report on other students’ performance. The system should enforce report-level
permissions – perhaps tie them to the same permissions as underlying data. Also, if reports
contain sensitive data (personnel info, or perhaps classified mission details if any), the output
must be protected. For instance, if exported to PDF, maybe apply watermarks or access control
in the UI to who can see it. In some cases, the system might need to redact or omit classified info
in generalized reports.
Formatting and Customization: Reports should be well-formatted for readability since they
may be presented in meetings or included in official documents. Non-functionally, this means
investing in a good reporting engine that can handle pagination, company (or unit) branding
(like logos, headers), and consistent styling. Users might want to customize the layout of certain
reports (e.g. include a unit logo or adjust columns). The system should allow some level of
template customization, possibly by the admin uploading a template or adjusting options.
Scalability: If many users request reports simultaneously (e.g. end of week everyone pulling
training reports), the system should scale or queue these tasks to handle the load. Offloading
heavy report generation to background jobs can help. Also, if the platform eventually serves
multiple schools, ensure that one school’s large report doesn’t impact another’s performance
(multi-tenancy isolation).
Audit: For auditing purposes, track report generation of sensitive data. For example, if someone
exports a list of all personnel, that might need to be logged (who ran it and when) because it
could contain PII. This is a security non-functional aspect but important in a military context
where data access is monitored.
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (Reporting)

```
Flight Authorization Log (Form): As mentioned in Authorization, generate a Flight
Authorization form/report daily that lists all scheduled flights, crew, risk level, and the
authorizing official’s name (with maybe a line for signature if printed). This report would mirror
the traditional flight authorization paperwork in a digital format – a requirement often unique to
military units. It should comply with whatever format the unit needs (which might be specified
by an Air Force Instruction or Navy manual).
```
```
33
```
#### • • • • • • •


```
Training Progress Reports: Military training programs often have periodic progress reviews for
students. The system should produce a Standard Progress Report for each student that
instructors and leadership can use in review boards. This might include the student’s grades,
strengths, weaknesses, and number of extra training rides if any. It should be formatted in a way
that aligns with how training review boards expect information (possibly a standardized form in
the training command).
Readiness & Resource Reports: Because military training ultimately feeds into operational
readiness, include reports that translate training data into readiness metrics. For instance,
“Number of graduates produced this quarter vs. requirement” or “Instructor pilot manning and
utilization rates”. A domain-specific need could be a report for higher headquarters showing
status of the training pipeline: how many are in training, washout rates, average time to
complete, etc. Similarly, resource reports might tie into maintenance: e.g. average aircraft
availability rate or cancellation causes (how many sorties canceled due to maintenance vs
weather). These are specific to military oversight needs (ensuring the training program is healthy
and resource constraints are managed).
Safety Reports: Military aviation places high importance on safety. The platform should be able
to support generating safety-related reports, such as trend analysis of Training Incidents or
Flight Discrepancies. If the system logs minor incidents (like “student busted altitude on 3
flights”), one could generate a report aggregating such data. Or a report of all hazard reports
submitted in training (if integrated with a safety system or if instructors can flag maneuvers as
safety concerns). This is domain-specific as it ties into the Aviation Safety program.
Certification and Compliance: Reports that demonstrate compliance with training and
regulatory requirements. For example, a report that lists all pilots and whether they have
completed their annual evaluations , required academic training (e.g. anti-G training,
instrument refresher), etc. This helps ensure the unit is in compliance with regulations. It’s
specific to the domain because these requirements come from military directives (like annual
testing, etc.). The system should be able to generate a compliance checklist report.
Multi-Level Aggregation: The platform might be used at a squadron level, but domain needs
might require data to roll up to a group or wing level. Reports should accommodate aggregation
across multiple units if needed. For instance, a wing commander might want a report combining
data from two squadrons. The requirement is that the system can, with proper access, aggregate
data by higher organization, reflecting the military organizational structure. This could involve
hierarchical reporting roles or export capabilities that allow higher HQ to merge inputs from
multiple system instances.
```
## Resource Management Module

**Overview:** The Resource Management module deals with physical resources required for training –
primarily aircraft, but also simulators, flight equipment, and facilities (like classrooms or ranges). Its
core functions include tracking resource availability, scheduling or deconflicting resources, and possibly
interfacing with maintenance systems to know when an asset is down for maintenance. The goal is to
optimize resource utilization and ensure training has the necessary resources available at the right
times.

### User Requirements (Resource Management)

```
Aircraft Status Tracking: Provide a real-time status board of all training aircraft. Users
(maintenance officers or schedulers) should be able to mark each aircraft as available , down for
maintenance , or other status (e.g. spare, scheduled inspection). This status should integrate with
scheduling – only available aircraft can be assigned to flights. If an aircraft goes down
```
#### • • • • • •


```
unexpectedly (breaks), a maintenance user can update its status, and the system will flag any
upcoming flights assigned to that tail number for rescheduling.
Simulator and Facility Scheduling: Include the ability to schedule simulators and other
facilities (classrooms, briefing rooms) as resources. This is similar to aircraft scheduling but for
ground resources. Users scheduling an academic lesson should reserve a classroom; scheduling
a sim event should reserve a sim bay. The system should prevent double-booking of the same
resource and show utilization. Possibly provide a separate calendar view for each type of
resource to see when it’s booked.
Maintenance Integration: If possible, integrate with the maintenance management system (or
allow input of maintenance events). The module could ingest planned maintenance schedules
(e.g. “Aircraft 123 in phase inspection from Jan 5-10”) so that schedulers know those aircraft are
unavailable. Additionally, allow quick submission of a maintenance request from the system
if an issue is reported (this could simply generate a notification to maintenance personnel).
While full maintenance tracking might be outside scope, at least a maintenance schedule
interface is needed.
Resource Allocation Optimization: When scheduling, the system can assist in choosing optimal
resources. For example, if multiple aircraft are available, the system might suggest using the one
with the least hours flown that week to balance wear (or follow any business rule given by
maintenance). Or for simulators, automatically assign the first free simulator of required type.
This is more of a smart feature: users can override, but it streamlines the process and ensures
even resource usage.
Inventory of Equipment: Optionally, track inventory of key equipment used in training (like NVG
goggles, parachutes, etc., if relevant). Users should be able to see how many of each item are
available and maybe assign them to flights or personnel. This ensures, for instance, if a night
flight is scheduled, that NVGs are available and not beyond inspection date. The UI for this might
be simpler (just a list of equipment and counts), but it helps the unit plan if certain equipment is
a limiting factor.
```
### Non-Functional Requirements (Resource Management)

```
Reliability: Resource status data must be reliable and up-to-date. Any changes (like an aircraft
marked down) should be immediately reflected to avoid scheduling errors. The system might
employ a push update mechanism for resource status (like the maintenance officer’s update
immediately pushes to all scheduler screens). In case of integration with external maintenance
systems, reliability of that integration (and handling of failures or lag) is important so that stale
data doesn’t mislead schedulers.
Performance: Queries and updates related to resources should be lightweight – typically there
are far fewer resources than personnel, so this module is not extremely data-heavy. However, it
might be accessed frequently by scheduling algorithms. Thus, updating an aircraft’s status or
fetching all available jets should be near-instant. If integrated with maintenance, possibly cache
some maintenance data to reduce external calls latency.
Usability: A clear UI for resource management is needed, as it’s often used under time pressure
(e.g. when something breaks, you quickly need to swap resources). A visual status board with
color codes (green for available, red for down, yellow for pending/trouble) would be useful.
Drag-and-drop could allow assigning a tail number to a mission. Also, make it easy to switch a
mission’s resource – e.g. if aircraft A is down, with two clicks assign aircraft B and notify crew.
This user-centered design will help operations run smoothly.
Scalability: Usually, the number of resources (aircraft, sims) is limited (dozens or maybe a
hundred), so performance is fine. But if the system covers multiple bases, it should be able to
partition resources by base or type. Also consider if the system might one day handle other
```

#### •

```
35
```
#### • • • • • •


```
resource types (like scheduling instructor availability as a “resource” in a sense) – ensure the
design is generic enough to extend to new resource types without massive overhaul.
Integration & Modularity: The Resource Management module may integrate with external
systems (maintenance software, inventory systems). Design it with a modular adapter pattern –
e.g. one implementation might pull data from a maintenance API, another might allow manual
entry. This way, whether or not the base has a computerized maintenance system, the platform
can work (either through integration or manual updates). Keep it modular so that changing an
external system’s API or adding a new resource type (like vehicles) can be done by adding a new
component rather than rewriting core logic.
Security: Access control is important here too – perhaps only maintenance or admin roles can
change resource statuses, whereas schedulers can view and assign but not mark a plane as
“fixed”. Also, the data of resource usage might be sensitive (some could infer operational tempo
from it), so ensure that only authorized users (mostly internal) can see details like how often an
aircraft flew, etc. Communication with external maintenance systems must be secure
(authenticated and encrypted).
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (Resource Management)

```
Military Maintenance Workflows: Military aircraft maintenance operates under specific rules.
The system should accommodate these – for example, if an aircraft is awaiting parts, it might be
down for an indefinite period; if it’s scheduled for a phase inspection after a certain number of
hours, the system should ideally know that threshold is approaching (maybe alert maintenance
at 10 hours out). Domain requirement: incorporate at least basic tracking of aircraft
flying hours and notify when maintenance is due (if not integrated with full maintenance
system). This ensures training doesn’t accidentally overschedule an aircraft beyond its limits.
Resource Prioritization: In a training wing, some aircraft might be prioritized for certain
training or have different configurations. The system may need to store tail-specific info like
“Aircraft 101 has an upgraded avionics suite used for instrument training” – so if scheduling an
instrument sortie, prefer 101. Or conversely, “Aircraft 202 has a minor defect, can’t be used for
formation” – and the system should prevent assigning it to formation sorties. These little
domain-specific details about each resource should be capturable (notes or attributes for each
tail number) and the scheduling logic should respect them.
Fuel and Sortie Turnaround: Military training can have quick turnarounds (one aircraft doing
multiple back-to-back sorties). The system should enforce a minimum ground time between
sorties for the same aircraft (e.g. 1 hour to refuel and inspect). This is a domain rule to ensure
maintenance has time to prep the aircraft. The scheduling module, aided by resource
management, should block someone from scheduling the same jet on two sorties too close
together.
Alternate Resource Planning: In the military context, contingency planning is common. The
system could allow designating alternate resources. For example, for each flight, an alternate
aircraft (or alternate instructor) is identified in case of primary resource failure. The
requirements might be that the system can list alternates and, if triggered (say primary aircraft
breaks), quickly swap to alternate with minimal input. This aligns with military practice of always
having a backup plan for missions.
Resource Utilization Reporting: The resource module should feed the Reporting module with
domain-specific metrics like aircraft utilization rate , maintenance downtime , etc. For
example, it should be able to report mean time between failures or downtime for each aircraft,
because military leadership will be interested in how effectively the fleet is being used. This
ties in with the readiness aspect – if resource availability is low, training throughput suffers. So
domain-specific requirement is to capture data needed for those metrics (like hours flown per

aircraft, number of cancellations due to maintenance) to generate reports that ultimately affect
maintenance and procurement decisions.
```
## System Administration Module

**Overview:** The System Administration module allows administrative users to configure and maintain
the platform. This includes managing user accounts, roles, permissions, and global settings (like
system-wide preferences, rule sets, etc.). It also covers audit logs, data backups, and integration
configuration. Essentially, this module is about the behind-the-scenes management to keep the
platform secure, up-to-date, and tailored to the organization’s needs.

### User Requirements (System Administration)

```
User Account Management: Enable admins to create, edit, and deactivate user accounts. They
should assign roles to each user (e.g. Student, Instructor, Scheduler, Maintenance, Commander,
Admin). The interface should allow bulk user import (perhaps from a CSV or via integration with
an HR system) to onboard a new class of students quickly. It should also handle password resets
or linking accounts to authentication methods (like CAC or SSO).
Role-Based Permission Configuration: Provide a clear UI to configure what each role can do
(RBAC – Role-Based Access Control). For example, define that an “Instructor” can fill training
records but cannot approve flights, whereas an “Ops Supervisor” can approve flights, etc. This
might be a matrix of permissions or a set of checkboxes per role. The system likely has default
roles, but the admin module should allow customizing them or adding new roles to fit any
unique positions.
System Configuration Settings: Allow configuration of system-wide settings such as: what
types of notifications are enabled by default, what are the rule parameters (e.g. maximum daily
flight hours for crew, default duty day length), thresholds for alerts (like notify when 10 days to
qualification expiry). The admin UI should make these configurable parameters easily viewable
and editable, ideally with safe defaults and explanations. This lets the platform be tailored to
each military organization’s policies without code changes.
Audit Log Access: Provide administrators with access to audit logs of user activities. There
should be an interface to search or filter these logs (e.g. “show all actions by user X” or “show all
changes to schedule on date Y”). This is helpful for troubleshooting and security audits. The
admin should also be able to export these logs if needed for investigations.
Data Management: Tools for data backup, restore, and archiving. For example, the admin
module could allow an admin to archive a completed class (move their records to an archive
state) which might improve system performance for active users. Also, an admin might trigger a
manual backup or download of data (especially before system updates). This could include
backing up configuration settings as well.
Integration & Modules Management: If the system has integration points (like with
maintenance system, or if modules can be toggled), the admin interface should let admins
configure these. For instance, enter API keys/URLs for external systems, schedule data sync
tasks, or enable/disable certain features. In a military setting, integration with authentication
systems (LDAP/Active Directory or CAC infrastructure) would be configured here – e.g. uploading
the trusted certificates, mapping roles from directory groups, etc.
Monitoring Dashboard: It can be useful to have a system health dashboard in the admin
module showing server status, usage statistics (# of active users, etc.), and any error alerts. This
helps the admin proactively address issues or coordinate with IT support.

### Non-Functional Requirements (System Administration)

```
Security & Access: Only highly trusted personnel (perhaps one or two per squadron or base)
should have the system admin role. This module must be extremely secure. It should enforce
multi-factor authentication for admin access (e.g. admin accounts may require CAC login plus
biometric or OTP). Every action here is sensitive, so audit logging for admin actions is critical.
Consider implementing the principle of least privilege – possibly separating duties (one admin
manages users, another manages system config, if needed).
Usability and Safety: Admin actions can have wide impact. The UI should include safeguards
(e.g. “Are you sure?” confirmations, especially for destructive actions like deleting a user or
changing a global setting). Possibly require double-confirmation or even dual-admin approval
for certain critical changes (like wiping data or altering an approval rule). Despite these
safeguards, the interface should remain clear and not overly complicated, since having a
confusing admin interface could lead to mistakes.
Audit and Compliance: The system administration functions must comply with any audit
requirements of the military. For example, if the system deals with classified or sensitive but
unclassified data, the administration of it might be subject to inspections. The software should
facilitate compliance by making logs easy to export and configuration easy to review (like a
report of all users and their roles, or all system settings values). Compliance with standards (e.g.
DoD Information Assurance guidelines) might require documentation; the system could assist by
producing a config baseline report.
Maintainability: The admin module should be built to accommodate updates to requirements.
New roles, new settings, or integration changes will happen – designing it in a way that adding a
new configurable parameter is straightforward (perhaps a generic settings table) will help
maintainability. Also, the interface should ideally be self-documenting (with help text) so new
admins can understand it without needing to read code.
Scalability: Even though the number of admin users is small, the actions might affect large data
sets (like archiving a whole class). Ensure that bulk operations (like user import or data archive)
are done efficiently (maybe asynchronously with a progress indicator) so that the admin UI
remains responsive. The module should handle scaling in terms of configuration as well – e.g. if
we add dozens of new config toggles over time, the UI should remain organized (maybe
categorized sections) to scale with feature growth.
Modularity: The admin module ties into all others, but it should be treated as a separate
component that can be secured and even deployed separately if needed (some systems have a
separate admin portal). Its design should not be too intertwined with business logic of other
modules – rather, it triggers changes by calling their interfaces or adjusting database entries.
This modular approach means the core modules enforce rules, while admin just sets the
parameters. It also means any failure or misuse in admin module should not directly break user-
facing functions (e.g. if an admin enters a nonsense configuration, the system should validate
and reject it, or at least fail gracefully).
```
### Domain-Specific Requirements (System Administration)

```
CAC/PKI Authentication Integration: In military environments, user authentication often uses
the DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or other Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards. A
domain-specific requirement is that the system supports CAC login for users and
administrators. This means integrating with DoD Public Key Infrastructure – likely configuring
the web servers to require client certificates. The admin module would handle mapping the
CAC’s certificate info to a user account on first login, etc. Additionally, the system should support
signing forms or approvals with CAC certificates if biometrics aren’t used universally.
STIG Compliance and Hardening: The system (including the admin module) must comply with
DoD Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) or similar cybersecurity requirements.
```
#### • • • • • • • •


```
Domain specifically, the admin should be able to apply security configuration like password
policies, session timeouts, and account lockout thresholds as dictated by these policies. For
instance, the admin interface could expose settings for “inactive session timeout = 15 minutes”
or “password complexity: 2 uppercase, 2 lowercase, 2 symbols” in line with DoD rules. This
ensures the software can be accredited for use on DoD networks.
Multi-Tenancy and Data Segregation: If the platform might serve multiple training units or
even different branches, the admin module must allow segregation of data. Domain
requirement could be that an Air Force training squadron’s data should never be visible to a Navy
training squadron on the same platform. This might be accomplished by separate instances or a
robust multi-tenant design with strict access controls. The admin module would then have to
manage tenants (maybe an admin of admins to create new unit spaces). While not needed if
each unit deploys its own system, the requirement should consider future scaling where a
centralized system serves many.
Localization for Terminology: Different military branches or countries may have different terms
(one might say “Sortie”, another “Mission”, etc.). The system admin module might include the
ability to customize certain terminology or data fields to match local doctrine. This is domain-
specific in that it allows the software to be used in various military contexts without hardcoding
one branch’s jargon. For example, an admin setting could let them rename the label “Flight
Commander” to “Section Leader” if needed, or toggle modules that aren’t used in some context.
Backup and Disaster Recovery Procedures: Military operations often require a continuity of
operations plan. The system should support domain-specific backup protocols, like taking
backups to a secure offline storage, or supporting an offline mode entirely if the network goes
down (perhaps a read-only offline backup server that can be used). Admins should be able to
initiate data exports that could be used to run the training program manually if needed (for
example, exporting next week’s schedule to a file in case systems are offline). This requirement
ensures the training mission can continue even in degraded IT scenarios, which is a military
consideration.
Audit Preparation: In the military, inspections (like Standardization and Evaluation audits, or IG
inspections) may require showing evidence of training management. The system should have
features to help with this, such as one-click generation of common audit data (e.g. list of all
current students and their status, list of instructors and last eval dates, etc.). While this overlaps
with reporting, it’s driven by administrative compliance needs. Ensuring the system can quickly
provide whatever documentation an inspection team asks for (within the scope of the system’s
data) is a valuable domain-specific capability.
```
## Cross-Cutting Development Considerations

While each module has specific requirements, there are overarching **development-side considerations**
that apply to the entire platform. These concern how the system is implemented with respect to
security, modularity, and scalability, as well as maintainability and overall architecture. The following
table summarizes these key cross-cutting requirements and their implications:

#### •

**Aspect Development Considerations and Requirements**

**Security**

```
Implement end-to-end security: Role-based access control for all modules
(granular permissions per role) ; strong user authentication (integration with
DoD CAC/PIV and biometrics for critical actions); encrypt data in transit (TLS
1.2/1.3) and at rest (database encryption for sensitive fields). Follow military
cybersecurity standards (e.g. NIST 800-53 controls, DoD STIGs) in development
and configuration. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. All
user actions should be auditable , with tamper-evident logs stored securely.
Ensure sensitive operations (like mission approvals, admin changes) have multi-
factor authentication and logging. The system should also enforce session
security (auto-logout on inactivity, protection against XSS/CSRF given it's web-
based).
```
**Modularity**

```
Design the system in a modular fashion, ideally using a microservices or layered
architecture. Each module (Scheduling, Training, etc.) should be a separable
component with a well-defined API interface. This allows independent
development, testing, and scaling of modules. For example, the scheduling
engine could be one service, the training records another – communicating
through secure APIs. Modules should be loosely coupled , meaning changes in
one (say, adding a new field in Training Records) has minimal impact on others.
The platform should be highly configurable to meet different organizational
needs without code changes , which is achieved via modular design (e.g. rule
engines or config files driving behavior). This modularity not only aids scalability
but also maintainability – updates or new features can be added to one module
without rewriting the entire system. All modules integrate into a cohesive whole
through an integration layer or message bus, ensuring seamless data flow.
```
**Scalability**

```
Build the platform to scale horizontally to support growing numbers of users,
data, and possibly multiple training sites. Use scalable technologies (e.g.
clustering for the application server, load balancers, database replication) so
that the system can handle peak loads (like all users checking schedules in the
morning). Plan for potentially thousands of concurrent users (if scaled to
multiple schools) and design with that capacity in mind (efficient database
queries, use of caching for frequent reads like schedule display). The system
should also scale in terms of data over years of operation – archiving strategies
and database sharding or partitioning might be used to keep performance
steady as records grow. If using cloud infrastructure, ensure it can auto-scale
under load. Also, test the system with large datasets and user loads to identify
bottlenecks early.

Aspect Development Considerations and Requirements
```
```
Performance
```
```
Apart from scaling, ensure the application is optimized for quick response.
Front-end performance matters for a good user experience – use
asynchronous loading, minimize heavy scripts, and optimize code so that pages
(especially data-heavy ones like calendars) load within a couple of seconds. On
the server side , use appropriate indexing in databases, caching of common
queries (like today’s schedule), and possibly queue background tasks (such as
report generation or sending bulk notifications) so they don’t block interactive
use. Set performance benchmarks for key actions (e.g., schedule view load
under 2s, report generation under 10s for typical range) and test against them.
Also consider the network environment – the app might be used on military
networks with potential bandwidth restrictions, so efficient data transfer
(sending only necessary data, possibly compressing) is important.
```
```
Maintainability
```
```
Write clean, well-documented code and use a modular structure to make
maintenance easier. The system will likely evolve with new training
requirements and tech updates, so using standard frameworks and clear
separation of concerns (MVC or similar patterns) will facilitate future developers.
Implement automated testing (unit and integration tests) for critical
components like the scheduling logic and qualification rule checks, to catch
regressions when changes are made. Provide an administrative UI that is largely
self-service for configuration, so that many tweaks do not require developer
intervention (e.g. new qualification types, rule changes can be done by admins).
Logging and error handling should be robust – in case of issues, errors should
be logged with enough detail to troubleshoot, and the system should fail
gracefully (e.g. if one module is down, others still function in isolation as much
as possible). Maintainability also includes providing support for updates : plan
for data migration if the schema changes, and use version control and CI/CD
pipelines to deploy updates with minimal downtime.
```
```
Compliance
```
```
Ensure the system complies with all relevant military and aviation regulations
for software and training records. This includes IT security certifications (Risk
Management Framework accreditation to get an Authority to Operate on
military networks), as well as compliance with records management (e.g. how
long training records must be kept) and possibly FAA or equivalent regulations if
any civilian crossover (for example, if the training records double as logbook
entries, they should meet logging requirements). Accessibility compliance
(Section 508) is also important for federal systems – the web interface should be
navigable via keyboard and screen readers for any users with disabilities. The
development must keep these in mind, using best practices to ensure the
platform can be certified for use in its environment.
```
Finally, it is worth noting that the platform’s design and requirements aim to **support the mission of
military flight training** by improving efficiency, transparency, and data-driven management. By
adhering to the above requirements and considerations, developers will implement a robust system
that enhances training operations while meeting the strict standards of military security and reliability.
Each module works in concert with others to deliver a cohesive user experience – from planning a flight,
getting it approved with biometric security, executing it and logging the outcome, to analyzing the
results and resources for continuous improvement. This comprehensive approach will ensure the
platform is both **user-friendly** for day-to-day use and **technically sound** for long-term sustainment
and scalability in the demanding context of military aviation training.


**Sources:** The requirements and considerations above are informed by best practices and features from
modern aviation scheduling and training systems. For instance, ProDIGIQ’s military flight operations
software emphasizes rule-based crew scheduling with real-time updates and conflict alerts , as
well as integrated views and reporting. Their training management (AQP) system highlights the
importance of electronic forms, curriculum integration, and performance tracking. Biometric
security’s role in defense operations is underscored by HID Global, noting that biometrics provide
secure identity assurance for critical missions. These sources, alongside military-specific regulations
and practices, guided the formulation of a system that is **feature-rich** , secure, and tailored to the
unique demands of military flight training.
